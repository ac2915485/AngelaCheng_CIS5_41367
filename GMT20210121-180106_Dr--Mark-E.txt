01:09:30	Albert Ma:	intresting
01:10:02	Albert Ma:	lol
01:17:52	Albert Ma:	how is git hub different then storing theing on google drive?
01:18:28	Albert Ma:	mhm
01:19:06	Albert Ma:	how much storage do you have
01:20:17	Albert Ma:	lol
01:23:29	Hisham Sudqi:	ouch
01:25:29	Joseph Ramirez Jr:	GitHub doesn't have a limit to it's storage, but it is recommended to keep repositories smaller than 1 GB and if necessary recommended to keep below 5 GB
01:30:09	Albert Ma:	do you still need the break after case 1
01:31:30	Albert Ma:	is it because when ever you use a switch that has a case you always need to break it out

01:34:57	Albert Ma:	so it returns 0?
01:37:43	Albert Ma:	will this code be put on git hub??
01:37:52	Albert Ma:	it looks cool
